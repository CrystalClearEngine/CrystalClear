# CrystalClear
The Crystal Clear Engine is a highly WIP game and software engine, so far written entierly in C#.

Since the engine is not even nearly complete, there is no version of this engine available to download.

The engine will be considered to have entered alpha when the five pillars have been made functional enough.

The five pillars of the Crystal Clear engine are:

1. ScriptingEngine
